# Overview

These are the steps that I use to set up my development workstations.  I have used
automated tools and scripts.  I believe those are useful for shared-workstation
team environments, but for personal workstations they are not worth the maintenance
overhead, in my experience.

Instead, for my personal workstations, I try to have the philosophy of
"just learn to use the defaults, unless they are missing or inconvenient".
I'll also symlink some config files/dirs into Dropbox, but on a selective
basis. 

So, what follows are some of the things I tend to install and tweak on my personal
workstations.  I've installed many other things related to the project du jour
which aren't documented here, but I've tried to remember to keep track of
most of the various little tweaks which I can never remember later.

This helps me, hopefully it helps you!
